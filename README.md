## Description

I have completed the development of my E-Commerce application using React.js! The application is fully responsive and built using pure CSS.
Rather than relying on a UI framework, I decided to challenge myself by building the application with pure CSS, enabling me to use a framework with confidence in the future.
You can apply filters based on multiple properties and sort products by price. The search bar is also connected to the shop page, allowing you to apply filters and sort products to the search results.
The Cart and Wish List functionality allows you to add or remove products from the product page, product item, and quick view.
I was personally impressed by React's state management and the seamless interaction between components, as well as the Redux store.
The shop page also features client-side pagination for the displayed products.
There are two product views available: Grid view and List view. On smaller screens, like mobile devices, the icons that switch between views won't be visible
I paid close attention to the small details throughout the development process.
